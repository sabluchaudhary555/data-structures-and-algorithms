## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Your preferred programming language runtime/compiler
- IDE or text editor (IntelliJ IDEA recommended based on project structure)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd data-structures-and-algorithms
```

3. Open in your IDE or explore individual files

## 💡 Usage

Each directory contains standalone implementations and solutions:

```bash
# Navigate to specific topic
cd 01-data-structures

# Run individual files based on your language
# Example for Java:
javac FileName.java
java FileName

# Example for Python:
python filename.py
```
